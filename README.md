# Surface tools
Welcome to Surface tools! a collection of tools for surface-based operations

Equivolumetric surfaces: creates equivolumetric surfaces based on the ratio of areas of the mesh surfaces, without the trouble of dealing with volumetric operations.

Equivolumetric surfaces (red) at 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 cortical depth on the BigBrain. Euclidean surface (yellow) at mid depth. The euclidean surface samples different layers in gyri and sulci.

Euclidean vs equivolumetric intensity sampling. The laminar peaks are better aligned using equivolumetric sampling than euclidean sampling.


Written by Konrad Wagstyl and Alexander Huth at a Brain Hack, a version is also available in Pycortex.
Casey Paquola and Richard Bethlehem were involved in piloting these scripts on CIVET and FreeSurfer respectively.

```bash
# install from git
pip install git+https://github.com/kwagstyl/surface_tools
```

This puts the `generate_equivolumetric_surfaces`-script in the `bin`-folder of the environment:

```bash
generate_equivolumetric_surfaces --help
usage: generate_equivolumetric_surfaces [-h] [--smoothing SMOOTHING]
                                        [--software {CIVET,freesurfer}] [--subject_id SUBJECT_ID]
                                        gray white n_surfs output

Generate equivolumetric surfaces between input surfaces

positional arguments:
  gray                  input gray surface
  white                 input white surface
  n_surfs               number of output surfaces, also returns gray and white surfaces at 0 and 1
  output                output surface prefix e.g., equi_left_{N}

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --smoothing SMOOTHING
                        fwhm of surface area smoothing (default=0mm)
  --software {CIVET,freesurfer}
                        surface software package
  --subject_id SUBJECT_ID
                        subject name if freesurfer
```

The code requires either CIVET and FreeSurfer to be installed.
### CIVET usage:    
```bash
generate_equivolumetric_surfaces --smoothing 0 gray_left.obj white_left.obj 5 equi_left
```  
Then you can use volume_object_evaluate to sample the intensities at the particular depth:   
volume_object_evaluate volume.mnc equi_left0.5.obj equi_left_intensities0.5.txt

### FreeSurfer usage 
(we assume CIVET as default, so if using freesurfer, specify with the freesurfer flag):     
```bash
generate_equivolumetric_surfaces --smoothing 0 <subj>/surf/lh.pial <subj>/surf/lh.white 5 lh.equi --software freesurfer --subject_id SUBJECT_ID
```

Then you can use mri_vol2surf to sample the intensities at the particular depth:   
```bash
mri_vol2surf --src volume.nii --out lh.equi_intensity_0.5.mgh --hemi lh --surf <subj>/surf/lh.equi0.5.pial --out_type mgh
```

### Release notes
This code has so far been tested on:   
- python 2.7 and 3.6, freesurfer v.6 and on linux (Ubuntu 16.04) and macOS (10.12.6)   
- python 2.7, CIVET 2.1, Ubuntu 12.04
